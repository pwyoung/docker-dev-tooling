# Goal
Make an image that can be used for all sort of Python dev work.

This exists to accelerate development of images that run on top of it;
it's tedious (and ant-social) to run "apt update" every 10 seconds...

# Notes
This might be used for some things such as Selenium w/xvfb, so Alpine is not a great choice.
